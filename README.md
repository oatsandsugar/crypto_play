Playing with cryptography for Tech for Business @ Cornell Tech. Read the paper [here](https://github.com/oatsandsugar/crypto_play/blob/master/stroll-history-encryption.pdf).

Feedback from faculty:
>Excellent work on your essay! I'm impressed that you took the time and effort to convert a lot of the more basic ciphers and encryption schemes to Python code in addition to the written component of the project. Writing a survey about historical ciphers and encryption schemes and analyzing their individual and comparative security was definitely an ambitious task for this project, and you performed it quite well. You demonstrated a great deal of understanding about some of the key basic concepts in cryptography as well, such as the nature of certain cryptographic attacks, information leakage, and security's correlation to a scheme's keyspace. Very well done!
